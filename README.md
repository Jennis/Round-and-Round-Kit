# Description

Adds 3D rotating view transitions to UINavigationController. 

I always liked how switching users on OSX rotates the view in a cube, and thought it would also be a nice way to switch
between contexts in iPhone applications. 

The cube transition is in the SDK, however unfortunately it's a private API. This kit adds two methods to 
UINavigationController to provide the same behavior. 

# Usage

Clone the module and run the example. 

## Pushing a view controller

```objective-c 
[navigationController pushViewController:_secondViewController rotated:YES];
```

## Popping a view controller 

```objective-c
[navigationController popViewControllerRotated:YES];
```

## Back button behavior 

Use SWIZZLE_BACK = YES (default) to tell the UINavigationController to track which animation style was used when 
pushing a view controller, and apply the same when popping. The benefit of this is you don't have to do anything to 
handle back button behavior.
